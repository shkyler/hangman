# Hangman
A fun hangman game for you to download and play.

To download clone this repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/shkyler/hangman.git`

To run use `python hangman.py`

The game is simple - you need to guess the word that the computer has chosen randomly. You guess it one letter at a time. Wrong answers will lose a life and start to hang the man! Right answers will show up in the correct the place in the word to help you.

The word list was downloaded from [here](http://www.rupert.id.au/resources/1000-words.php)

Feel free to use this for whatever purpose you like - but I would appreciate an acknowlegement if you do.
